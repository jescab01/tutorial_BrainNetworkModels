    "# Brain Network Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a brain network model is an efficient way of simulating an in-silico version of a real brain. There are two key elements that compose these models: an structural connectivity matrix that serves as the skeleton for the virtual brain; and the neural mass models (NMM) that are placed in each vertex of that skeleton to reproduce electrophysiological activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "These models allow to perform experiments that might not be plausible with real brains either due to  technical or ethical reasons. They are key to integrating evidences from multiple levels of analysis, to check for their mutual coherence, and to test the directions of causal relationships between them. They provide enough flexibility to face different problems at hand, using specific NMMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Surely, these models are not real brains. They are abstract representations that reproduce specific aspects of real brains, and that become useful to tackle specific research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this tutorial, you will be provided information on how these models are built (within [The Virtual Brain](https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/) (TVB) simulation platform; [Sanz-Leon et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2013.00010)) and how you can adapt them to your own research questions. We will flow from the general ouput of these models into the specific parts that compose them. We will show different perspectives to understand the functioning of these models. \n",

    "## 1. Performing a simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The output are the simulated signals generated by the model. These signals represent the source-space of our in-silico brain models, with a signal per region included in the parcellation atlas used for the structural matrix. As in empirical neuroimaging studies, signals are just the raw material that will be analyzed to answer the research questions at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we expect to provide the tools to build such type of models, and you are in charge of thinking how this models could be applied to your specific research questions. \n"

    "To deepen the behaviour of a dynamical system such as a NMM, two analitical tools from physics become insightful: the phase plane and the bifurcation diagrams. A **phase plane** is a graphical representation of the state variables of a dynamical system against each other. It is commonly used to analyze the qualitative behavior of the system over time by examining the shape, stability and patterns of its trajectories. Through these analysis, we search for atractors (i.e., trajectories that the system tend to approach or converge to over time) such as *equilibrium points* in which the system remains static indefinitely, and *limit cycles* in which the system follows a closed trajectory repeatedly in the phase space without converging into a equilibrium point.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a **bifurcation diagram** is a graphical representation that shows the potential states of a system as a function of one parameter. For instance, NMMs are usually fed by intrinsic or extrinsic inputs such that an elevated input leads to a limit cycle (i.e., oscillatory activity), while a low input leads to an equilibrium point (no oscillation). The *bifurcation point* or *critical point* is the parameter value at which the system changes its behaviour, for example, switching from equilibrium to limit cycle state (see [Deco & Jirsa, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2523-11.2012)).  \n",

By default, the output of simulating the JR model in TVB gathers data regarding y0, y1, y2, and y3 state variables, however this set could be extended to the rest of state variables (i.e., y4 and y5) by changing the parameter \"variables_of_interest\" of the model.

    "The integrator defines the methods used for solving the systems of differential equations at each timestep. There are several integration methods implemented in TVB, we will comment on two of them: the Euler's and the Heun's methods. The Euler's method is the simplest method for calculating the trajectory of a dynamical system and is based on the calculation of the derivatives at each timepoint directly using it to update the trajectory. The Heun's method is known as an improved version of Euler's, and it takes several consecutive derivatives to estimate the next trajectory step. This makes Heun's method more stable and precise, at the cost of being more computationally heavy. Both methods could be implemented in a deterministic or stochastic fashion, allowing for the introduction of noise into the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important parameter of the integrator is the step size (i.e., dt). The larger the step size, the faster the computation times. However, its important to be aware that some models may require shorter step sizes to be integrated without instabilities. Additionally, in the case of stochastic integration, the magnitude of the implemented noise could also lead to instabilities. So, whenever having issues implementing a new neural mass model, check whether the integration method, the step size, or the noise magnitude may be generating instabilities.  \n",
