    "# Neural Mass Models\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural mass model is a set of equations that describe the dynamics and behaviour of a large population of interconnected neurons as a collective entity. Instead of focusing on the detailed activity of individual neurons, a neural mass model provides a simplified representation of the average behaviour of the population. These models often include subpopulations to reproduce functional and biological features of the neural tissue, for instance, excitatory and inhibitory subpopulations and describing their interactions. A neural mass aims to capture the macroscopic behaviour of the population, such as the overall firing rate or synchronization patterns, rather than the precise spiking activity of individual neurons. They are especially useful for studying phenomena at a larger scale, such as cortical columns or brain regions. The rationale behind this approach has been previously discussed:\n",

As they are connected, the model assumes that each oscillator influences each other, causing their phases to align or synchronize over time.

    "\n",
    "A reduced NMM is a mathematical simplification of a detailed and complex spiking neural network in which differential equations simulate the activity of individual cells often including different types, electrophysiological behaviours, and synaptic couplings. This set of N coupled equations (at least one per cell) is reduced through a mathematical technique called mean field reduction, to a small set of equations that captures the averaged behaviour of the whole population. Individual variability is usually neglected, however, the behaviour of different subpopulations of neurons (e.g., excitatory and inhibitory neurons) could be captured in the model with separated equations. This way, a reduced model could either result in a single differential equation or in a limited set of coupled differential equations including one per subpopulation. The parameters of the model, such as synaptic efficacies or time constants, are usually estimated or fitted based on experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind the mean field reduction is to assume that the behaviour of each neuron is influenced primarily by the average activity of the other neurons, and therefore, just averaged firing rates or membrane potentials could describe the dynamics of the system."

Their model integrated two pools of excitatory pyramidal cells, to encode two different stimuli associated with their decision-making context, and inhibitory interneurons (80%, 20%).

The resulting reduced model included two differential equations to represent the averaged firing rate activity of each of the two pyramidal pools. \n",

    "In 2008, Roxana Stefanescu and Viktor Jirsa, published the reduction of two spiking neural networks built with phenomenological models of individual neurons behaviour: the Fitzhug-Nagumo (FHN) neuron model [(FitzHugh, 1961; ](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fs0006-3495(61)86902-6) [Nagumo et al., 1962)](https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288235) and Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neuron model [(Hindmarsh & Rose, 1984)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1984.0024). FHN model reproduces the oscillatory behaviour of neurons through a set of two coupled differential equations, one representing the excitation of the system including the fast dynamics of action potentials and another representing the slow dynamics of recovery and repolarization processes. The HR model is an extension of the FHN model a similar structure (i.e., excitation and recovery variables) but incorporating an additional differential equation to account for neural adaptation mechanisms. This way the model captures a wider range of neural dynamics including regular spiking, but also bursting and chaotic behaviour. For the sake of brevity, we will focus here on the reduction of the HR model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spiking neural network built by [Stefanescu & Jirsa (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000219) consisted of 200 neurons (either FHN or HR), including 150 excitatory and 50 inhibitory and coupled linearly and instantaneously as gap junctions. Therefore, this network model does not account for phenomena related to slow chemical synaptic coupling. They used different coupling strengths for the connections within the excitatory population ($K_{11}$), from excitatory to inhibitory ($K_{21}$), and vice versa ($K_{12}$). Inhibitory-inhibitory connections were neglected as they are established with low probability. \n",

For the HR model, it produces: I < 1.32 - fixed point dynamics; I > 1.32 - spike-burst behaviour; 2.92 < I < 3.40 - chaotic regime;  and I > 3.4 simple oscillatory dynamics. All these types of behaviour were included in the reduced model by defining 3 modes of neural activity (i.e., small, medium, and high I values) that would be considered during the simulation of the model. \n",

    "## 3. Biologically-informed models\n",
    "\n",
    "A biologically-informed neural mass model aims to capture the dynamics of large-scale neural populations incorporating biophysical details and principles observed in real biology. This may include considerations of synaptic interactions, neural membrane dynamics, inhibitory-excitatory balance, and other factors that influence population-level dynamics. They represent populations of neurons as a single entity, characterized by variables such as average firing rates or membrane potentials. These models are often grounded in empirical observations and experimental data. They strive to reproduce or explain experimental findings, such as oscillations, evoked responses, or other population-level phenomena observed in neural recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite trying to incorporate biophysical details, they involve simplifications and approximations. These models strike a balance between biological realism and computational feasibility, enabling researchers to gain a deeper understanding of large-scale brain dynamics and make predictions about neural activity under different conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the last thirty years of the 20th century, a set of extraordinary elegant scientific developments set the foundations of what we know today as biologically-informed neural masses. Indeed, even the reduced models presented earlier have some elements inherited from these older ones. \n"

    "\n",
    "The model proposed in 1972 by Hugh R. Wilson and Jack D. Cowan was one of these relevant advances. They described the collective behaviour of populations of neurons based on their firing rate and highlighted the importance of the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory processes in the brain:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"*all nervous processes of any complexity are dependent upon the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory cells*\". ...  It was just this failure to consider inhibition that led Ashby et al. (1962) to conclude that the dynamical stability of the brain was paradoxical, and it was the introduction of inhibition by Griffith (1963) which dissolved the paradox. Consequently, we take it to be essential that there be both excitatory and inhibitory cells within any local neural population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The model assumes that the behaviour of each population can be described by a single variable, representing the average firing rate of the neurons within that population. Therefore, the dynamics of each population are described by a set of differential equations that capture the balance between excitation and inhibition.\n",
