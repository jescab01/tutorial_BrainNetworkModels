    "# Brain Network Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a brain network model (BNM) is an efficient way of simulating an in-silico version of a real brain. Two key elements compose these models: a structural connectivity matrix that serves as the skeleton of the virtual brain; and the neural mass models (NMMs) that are placed in each vertex of the skeleton to reproduce electrophysiological activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "These BNMs allow us to perform experiments that might not be plausible with real brains either due to technical or ethical reasons. They are key to integrating evidence from multiple levels of analysis, checking for their mutual coherence, and testing the directions of causal relationships between them. They provide enough flexibility to face different problems at hand, using specific NMMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Surely, these models are not real brains. They are abstract representations that reproduce specific aspects of real brains, and that become useful to tackle specific research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this tutorial, you will be provided information on how these models are built (within [The Virtual Brain](https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/) (TVB) simulation platform; [Sanz-Leon et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2013.00010)) and how you can adapt them to your own research questions. We will flow from the general output of these models into the specific parts that compose them. We will show different perspectives to understand the functioning of these models. \n",

    "## 1. Performing a simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform a simulation, you need to import necessary packages, define simulation parameters, and run it. Let's start from the result. The output of a BNM simulation implemented in TVB is a set of timeseries. These timeseries represent the source-space signals of our in-silico brain models, with a signal per region included in the parcellation atlas used for the structural matrix. As in empirical neuroimaging studies, signals are just the raw material that will be analyzed to answer the research questions at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we expect to provide the tools to build such types of models. You are in charge of thinking about how these models could be applied to your specific research questions. \n"

    "To deepen the behaviour of a dynamical system such as a NMM, two analytical tools from physics become insightful: the phase plane and the bifurcation diagrams. A **phase plane** is a graphical representation of the state variables of a dynamical system against each other. It is commonly used to analyze the qualitative behaviour of the system over time by examining the shape, stability and patterns of its trajectories. Through this type of analysis, we search for attractors (i.e., trajectories that the system tends to approach or converge to over time) such as *equilibrium points* in which the system remains static indefinitely, and *limit cycles* in which the system follows a closed trajectory repeatedly in the phase space without converging into an equilibrium point.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a **bifurcation diagram** is a graphical representation that shows the potential states of a system as a function of one parameter. For instance, NMMs are usually fed by intrinsic or extrinsic inputs such that an elevated input leads to a limit cycle (i.e., oscillatory activity), while a low input leads to an equilibrium point (no oscillation). The *bifurcation point* or *critical point* is the parameter value at which the system changes its behaviour, for example, switching from equilibrium to limit cycle state (see [Deco & Jirsa, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2523-11.2012)).  \n",

By default, the output of simulating the JR model in TVB gathers data regarding y0, y1, y2, and y3 state variables, however, this set could be extended to the rest of state variables (i.e., y4 and y5) by changing the parameter \"variables_of_interest\" of the model.

    "\n",
    "The integrator defines the method used for solving the systems of differential equations. There are several integration methods available in TVB. We will comment on two of them: Euler's and Heun's methods. Euler's method calculates the trajectory of a dynamical system based just on its derivatives in time. On the other hand, Heun's method is known as an improved version of Euler's, it takes several consecutive derivatives to estimate the next trajectory step and minimize integration errors. This makes Heun's method more stable and precise, at the cost of being more computationally expensive. Both methods could be implemented in a deterministic or stochastic fashion, allowing for the introduction of noise and random initial states in the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important parameter of the integrator is the step size of the derivatives (i.e., dt). The larger the step size, the less simulated datapoints and the faster the computation times. However, is important to choose an adequate step size for the NMM used to avoid simulation instabilities. Note that different models may be defined at different timescales: a timestep for model A may represent a millisecond while a timestep for another model may represent a second. Additionally, in the case of stochastic integration, the magnitude of the implemented noise could also lead to instabilities. So, whenever having issues implementing a new neural mass model, check whether the integration method, the step size, or the noise magnitude may be generating instabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With an stochastic integrator, noise is added at each integration timestep for each state variable of the system. In the case of the original JR, the noise is implemented just thorugh the intrinsic input (i.e., p + $\\eta$) to the excitatory interneurons (y1). This is a much more controlled implementation of noise than the stochastic integration. Therefore, for JR, we are not using the integrator noise. However, we use the stochastic Heun's integrator for another relevant reaseon, the randomization of initial state variables (note that each simulation produces a different temporal trace). \n",

    "Usually, coding for any application (in our case computational neuroscience) is developed in an integrated development environment (IDE), a software that provides useful tools to write and debug code, such as Spyder or Pycharm. Now, go to Pycharm to work on the last assignments.\n",

    "> **Exercise 6.** Build, simulate and plot the JR-BNM in Pycharm. Use the code and tools provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise 7 (optional).** A) Explore the behaviour of a single JR-NMM when varying its parameters taue and taui. As time constants, they have a strong impact on the oscillatory frequency (see chart below). How would you explore their impact? Hint: get some inspiration from functions/mixes.py. B) Explore the behaviour of parameters He and Hi (amplitude of PSP). Do they affect the frequency of oscillation? ![](images/FrequencyCharts_tau.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise 8.** Using the *project* bar in Pycharm, look in the *external libraries* for the tvb packages. Could you find the code for the Linear coupling function? How many model types are implemented in TVB? What's the size (kB) of the paupau connectivity in tvb-data?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise 9.** Build, simulate and plot a BNM with a neural mass of your interest, and different from JR-NMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise 10.** Give a thought on whether these types of models could help you in your research. What could you do with a virtual version of your participants' brains? What hypothesis would you test on a generic virtual brain? What limitations do you expect from using these models?"
